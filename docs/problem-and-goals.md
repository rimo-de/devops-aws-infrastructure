# Problem & Goal of this Project

## Problem Statement

Modern applications are increasingly built as collections of microservices that must communicate reliably while remaining scalable, fault-tolerant, and easy to deploy. Manually provisioning AWS infrastructure, configuring EC2 instances, and deploying containerized services can be time-consuming, error-prone, and difficult to reproduce across environments. Without a standardized and automated approach, ensuring that all services work together seamlessly becomes a significant operational challenge.

## Goal

The goal of this project is to provide a clear and reproducible DevOps solution for deploying containerized microservices on AWS. This repository demonstrates how to provision EC2 instances, install and configure Docker, and deploy multiple microservices so they operate as a cohesive system. The focus is on automation, consistency, and reliability, enabling teams to deploy and manage microservices efficiently in a real-world AWS environment.
